# Project Name: Building Conversational Agents with LangChain

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build conversational agents using LangChain, a powerful library that integrates Language Models (LLMs) and facilitates tool and API integration. By following this guide, you can create agents that interact with users, understand natural language inputs, and generate coherent responses based on the provided prompts.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.8 + installed
- LangChain library
- OpenAI API key
- SERP API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/JTarakRam/Build-your-own-Agent.git`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install langchain`
3. Set up the API keys: Replace `SERPAPI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the `secret_key.py` file with your respective API keys.
